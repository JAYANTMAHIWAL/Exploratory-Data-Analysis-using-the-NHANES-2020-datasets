## 📊 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Clean, preprocess, and explore the NHANES 2020 data.
- Identify correlations and trends in health and nutrition metrics.
- Generate visualizations to provide a clear understanding of the dataset.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data normalization, and feature selection.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Univariate and multivariate analysis.
  - Statistical summaries and distribution analysis.
  - Correlation heatmaps.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Interactive and static plots using Python libraries.
  - Identification of key health and nutrition insights.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
